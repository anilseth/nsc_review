Some masses may represent bulge masses rather than total stellar masses.
Especially, early type masses from Graham09,Saglia16,Nguyen18.
Nguyen18 masses uncertain source -- may actually be Georgiev18

Mass determinations for two galaxies from Neumayer12 that had low stellar masses (probably because they are bulge mass estiates):
NGC3998: m-M=30.76, D=14.2, Cosmicflows SBF Distance, K_s=7.365, 4.6e10 Lsol in K, assume M/L_K=1, this is much higher than bulge mass
NGC2787: m-M=29.35, D=7.41 Mpc, Cosmicflows SBF distance, K_s=7.26, 1.39e10 Lsol in K, assume M/L_K=1, 


For NGC3621 Galaxy mass find M_K=-22.50 from 2MASS LGA and 6.6 Mpc.  Assume M/L_K=0.75 as in Barth+ 2009.

M31
V_nuc=12.55, M_V=-12.1 from Kormendy99, they assume M/L_V=5.7 --> 3.5e7 Msol

NGC4395 stellar mass estimate:
Use Reines15 gives logmass=8.90
NSAID 89394 g-i=0.22, this gives M/L_i=0.24 from Roediger relation
denBrok15 gives M_i=-17.9, this suggest 2.1e8 Msol; Kormendy finds an even lower mass.
